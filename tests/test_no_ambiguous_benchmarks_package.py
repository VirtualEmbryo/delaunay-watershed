"""The ambiguous top-level `benchmarks` name must not be importable.

Both this repository and `foambryo` used to ship a top-level package literally named
`benchmarks`. A script that put both repository roots on `sys.path` (e.g. a research
script that resolves the sibling repository by path rather than by its installed
package) could then have `import benchmarks` / `from benchmarks.metrics import ...`
silently resolve to whichever repository came first on `sys.path` -- see the project's
research history for the collision this caused in practice, and `BENCHMARKS.md`'s
"package renamed" section for the fix.

This repository's package is now `dw3d_benchmarks`. This test fails (loudly, at
collection or otherwise) if the ambiguous name `benchmarks` can ever supply the
dangerous attribute again -- `benchmarks.metrics` -- whether from a real reintroduced
package, or from a stray sibling checkout on `sys.path`.

A later check found that `import benchmarks` is not always the right check: this
repository's own working tree, right after the package rename, still had a gitignored
`benchmarks/__pycache__/` left on disk from before the `git mv`, with `benchmarks/`'s
`__init__.py` gone. Python happily imports that as an implicit namespace package (PEP
420) -- `import benchmarks` succeeds, `benchmarks.__file__` is `None` -- which made the
original assert-it-raises version of this test fail on a real, freshly-migrated
checkout it was specifically meant to protect, while the actual hazard (a second
`benchmarks.metrics` shadowing this repository's) was already gone. See
`CHANGELOG.md`'s note on that rename for the checkout-hygiene fix (delete the stray
directory) this test no longer needs in order to pass.
